# verySimpleCPU
Baris YAGAN
This is my own CPU design which is very simple and consists of 16 fundamental instructions. 
Therefore I called it verySimpleCPU. There is both my own CPU design and a test file which 
checks whether my design working or not with given instructions set. 
I developed this project for my college CS course.
